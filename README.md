# CodeVault

Welcome to **CodeVault**, the repository where I document my coding journey. This repo contains my progress, challenges, and learnings in **C** and **C++**, two core programming languages in my current coding adventure.

## Repository Structure

- **C Folder**: Contains day-wise work, exercises, and challenges related to the C programming language. Each day folder documents my progress, key concepts learned, and any code snippets or solutions to problems.
- **C++ Folder**: Similarly, this folder stores my day-wise work and progress as I continue learning C++. Each folder contains code snippets, solutions to challenges, and documentation of new concepts I've explored.

For larger **projects**, I maintain a separate repository dedicated to those, which you can explore [here](link_to_projects_repo).

## Technologies Covered

- **C**: Basic programming concepts, arrays, functions, pointers, structures, and more.
- **C++**: Object-oriented programming, classes, inheritance, polymorphism, and further exploration of advanced topics in C++.

## How to Navigate

- **C Folder**: Start here to follow my learning journey in C, from basic concepts to more advanced topics.
- **C++ Folder**: Dive into my ongoing C++ learning journey, where I document daily exercises and projects as I progress.
  
You can also explore my [projects repo](link_to_projects_repo) for coding projects that showcase my growing understanding of the languages.

## Contributing

Feel free to explore my code, ask questions, or offer suggestions! If you'd like to contribute, fork the repository, make changes, and open a pull request. Iâ€™m always looking to improve my understanding and collaborate with others.
