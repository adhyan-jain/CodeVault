/*
Write a program to store n elements in an array and get a number to search. Your program should display whether the search number is present in the array or not. 

Input format :
The first line of input consists of the number of elements n in the array.
The second line of input consists of the n array elements, separated by space.
The third line of input consists of the search number.

Output format :
The output should display whether the given search number is present in the array or not.

Refer to the sample output for formatting specifications.

Code constraints :
The maximum size of the array is 10.

Sample test cases :

Input 1 :
5
1 2 3 4 5
3
Output 1 :
The number 3 is present in the array

Input 2 :
5
1 2 3 4 5
6
Output 2 :
The number 6 is not present in the array
