/*
Henry is working on a number manipulation task where he performs the following operations:

1.	Calculate the sum of each digit of a number N raised to the power P.
2.	Sum up the modified digits.
3.	Apply certain conditions based on the sum of the digits and further modify the sum:
•	If the sum of digits is not divisible by 5, and the sum is even, divide it by 3.
•	If the sum of digits is divisible by 5, multiply the sum by 2.

Help Henry to complete his task.

Example:

Input:
23 2

Output:
13

Explanation:
Input: N = 23, P = 2
Sum of Digits Raised to Power: 22 + 32 = 4 + 9 = 13
The sum of Digits of 13: 1+ 3 = 4.
Condition: Since 4 % 5 != 0, and 13 is odd, the sum remains 13.

Input format :
The input contains two integers, N and P, where: N is the number. P is the power each digit is raised to.

Output format :
The output should print the final modified sum after all calculations.

Refer to the sample output for formatting specifications.

Code constraints :
The given test cases fall under the following constraints:
1 ≤ N ≤ 10000
1 ≤ P ≤ 100

Sample test cases :

Input 1 :
23 2
Output 1 :
13

Input 2 :
34 3
Output 2 :
182

Input 3 :
15 1
Output 3 :
2
