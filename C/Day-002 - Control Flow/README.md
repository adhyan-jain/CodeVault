# Day 2: Control Statements

Welcome to Day 2 of my C programming journey! Today, I focused on control statements and logical operators, which are essential for making decisions in programs.

## ðŸš€ Topics Covered
- **Conditional Statements:**
  - `if`, `if-else`, and `switch-case` for making decisions in code.
- **Logical Operators:**
  - Using `&&`, `||`, and `!` for combining or negating conditions.

## ðŸ’» Programs Written
The code for the following programs can be found in this folder in this repository:
1. **Find the Largest and Smallest of 3 Numbers:** A program that takes three numbers and determines the largest and smallest among them.
2. **Student Grade Calculator:** A program that calculates the grade of a student based on the input marks.
3. **Menu-Driven Calculator:** A simple calculator that performs operations based on user input using a `switch-case` structure.
4. **Divisibility Check Program:** A program that checks if a number is divisible by both 3 and 5.
5. **Positive, Negative, or Zero Check:** A program that checks whether a given number is positive, negative, or zero.
6. **Temperature Conversion Program:** A program that converts temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit.
7. **Leap Year Checker:** A program to determine if a given year is a leap year.
8. **Quadratic Equation Solver:** A program to find the roots of a quadratic equation.

## ðŸ§  Key Learnings
- **Conditional Statements:** I learned how to use `if`, `if-else`, and `switch-case` to control the flow of a program based on conditions.
- **Logical Operators:** I became familiar with logical operators like `&&`, `||`, and `!` to combine conditions and create more complex decision-making processes.
- **Practical Applications:** Implementing these concepts helped me build useful programs such as a menu-driven calculator and a temperature conversion tool, which are common in everyday applications.

## ðŸš€ Next Steps
- In the next session, I will explore **Loops** (`for`, `while`, `do-while`), which will allow me to execute code repeatedly under certain conditions.
