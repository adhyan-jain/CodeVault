Problem Statement

Amit and Angel wants to create a program where they are given the ages of two people, a current year, and a future year. They want to calculate the number of years until one person is twice as old as the other. 

Help them in creating the program using a loop.

Example

Given the ages of two persons (age1 = 8, age2 = 24), a current year (2024) and a future year (2036), iterate from the current year to the future year to find a year where one person's age will be twice the other's age.

After 8 years (in 2032), one person will be twice as old as the other (age1 + years = 16, age2 + years = 32), satisfying the condition, and thus the output is 8 years.
Input format :
The first line of input consists of an integer A, representing the age of the first person.
The second line consists of an integer B, representing the age of the second person.
The third line consists of an integer C, representing the current year.
The fourth line consists of an integer F, representing the future year.
Output format :
If the condition is met, print an integer representing the year in which one person will be twice as old as the other.
Otherwise, print "No such year found up to F", where F is an integer representing the future year.

Refer to the sample output for formatting specifications.
Code constraints :
In this scenario, the test cases fall under the following constraints:
1`≤ A, B ≤ 100
1960`≤ C, F ≤ 2100
Sample test cases :
Input 1 :
8
24
2024
2036
Output 1 :
8
Input 2 :
8
24
2024
2030
Output 2 :
No such year found up to 2030
Input 3 :
25
20
2022
2028
Output 3 :
No such year found up to 2028
Input 4 :
60
30
2024
2040
Output 4 :
0

    for (int year = currentYear; year<=futureYear; year++){
        int newAge1 = age1 + years;
        int newAge2 = age2 + years;
        if (newAge1 == 2*newAge2 || newAge2 ==2*newAge1){
            printf("%d",years);
            found=1;
            break;
        }
        years++;
    }
    if (!found){
        printf("No such year found up to %d\n",futureYear);
    }
    return 0;
