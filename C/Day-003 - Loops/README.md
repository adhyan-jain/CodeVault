# Day 3: Loops

Welcome to Day 3 of my C programming journey! Today, I focused on loops, which are crucial for repeating tasks and iterating through data. I also learned how to control the flow within loops using `break` and `continue`.

## ðŸš€ Topics Covered
- **Loops:**
  - `for`, `while`, and `do-while` loops for repetitive execution.
- **Nested Loops:** Using loops within loops to solve more complex problems.
- **Flow Control in Loops:** Understanding the use of `break` and `continue` statements to control loop behavior.

## ðŸ’» Programs Written
The code for the following programs can be found in the **[Day 3 folder](#)** in this repository:
1. **Multiplication Tables:** A program to print multiplication tables for numbers 1â€“10.
2. **Fibonacci Sequence:** A program to generate the first 20 Fibonacci numbers using a loop.
3. **Patterns:**
   - Right Triangle of numbers.
   - Isosceles Triangle of numbers.
   - Diamond pattern.
4. **Factorial Calculator:** A program to calculate the factorial of a number using a loop.
5. **Prime Number Check:** A program that checks if a given number is prime.
6. **Sum of Even Numbers:** A program to calculate the sum of all even numbers from 1 to `n`.
7. **Reverse a Number:** A program to reverse the digits of a given number.
8. **GCD and LCM Calculator:** A program to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) and least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers.

## ðŸ§  Key Learnings
- **Looping Constructs:** I learned how to use `for`, `while`, and `do-while` loops to perform repetitive tasks, which is essential for processing large sets of data or performing the same task multiple times.
- **Nested Loops:** I used loops within loops to solve problems such as printing patterns and generating the Fibonacci sequence.
- **Flow Control:** The `break` and `continue` statements are useful for prematurely terminating a loop or skipping an iteration, respectively.
- **Practical Problem-Solving:** These programs provided great practice in applying loops to solve real-world problems, such as checking for prime numbers and calculating the factorial of a number.

## ðŸš€ Next Steps
- In the next session, I will explore **Arrays and Strings**, which will help in storing and manipulating data efficiently.
