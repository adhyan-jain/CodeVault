Day 11: Unions

Learning Focus:
1.	Unions Basics:
2.	Declaration, initialization, and accessing members.
3.	Understanding memory sharing and union vs. structure comparison.
4.	Bit field

Practice:

1.	Write a program to demonstrate memory sharing in a union by assigning values to multiple members and printing their effects.
2.	Calculate and print the size difference between a union and a structure containing identical members (int, float, char).
3.	Create a union with bit fields for a flag (1-bit), a status code (3-bit), and an error code (4-bit), and output their values after taking user input.
4.	Create a program that uses a union to store a character and an integer and outputs both after assigning a value to each.
5.	Implement a program to manage student records using a union that stores either a GPA (float) or an ID (int), based on user choice.
6.	Write a program to represent a file's properties (size, type, or hidden flag) using a union and display the assigned value.
7.	Design a program to store and print a date in multiple formats (e.g., dd-mm-yyyy and mm/dd/yyyy) using a union.
