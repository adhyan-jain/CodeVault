Problem Statement

Anil wants to calculate the interest earned on a fixed deposit. The rules are as follows:
•	For a regular account: The interest rate is 5% per annum.
•	For a senior citizen account: The interest rate is 7% per annum.
•	If the deposit duration exceeds 5 years, apply a bonus interest of Rs 10,000.
•	If the principal amount is above Rs 1,00,000, apply a 3% bonus on the interest.

Formula:
Total Interest = (Principal × Interest Rate × Duration) + Bonus Interest (if applicable) + Interest Bonus (if applicable)
Input format :
The first line contains a double d representing the Principal Amount in Rs.
The second line contains an integer n representing the Duration of the deposit in years.
The third line contains a char c representing the Account Type: ('R' for Regular Account and 'S' for Senior Citizen Account).
Output format :
The output should print the Total Interest earned in Rs, rounded to two decimal places.

Refer to the sample output for formatting specifications.
Code constraints :
The given test cases fall under the following constraints:
The Principal Amount should be a positive number.
The Duration should be a positive integer.
The Account Type should be either 'R' (Regular) or 'S' (Senior Citizen).
Sample test cases :
