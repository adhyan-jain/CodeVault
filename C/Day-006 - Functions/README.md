Day 6: Functions

Learning:

•	User-defined functions: Declaration, definition, and calling.

•	Rescursion

•	Function parameters: passing by value and reference.


Practice:
1.	Calculate the factorial of a number.
2.	Check if a number is prime.
3.	Generate the nth Fibonacci number using recursion.
4.	Reverse a string using recursion.
5.	Find the GCD of two numbers using recursion.
6.	Swap two numbers using pass by value.
7.	Swap two numbers using pass by reference.
8.	Solve a quadratic equation using math functions.
9.	Compute the sum of the first n natural numbers using recursion.
10.	Calculate the area and circumference of a circle using function parameters
