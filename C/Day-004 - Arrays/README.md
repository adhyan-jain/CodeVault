# Day 4: Arrays

Welcome to Day 4 of my C programming journey! Today, I delved into **arrays**, a fundamental concept in programming that allows us to store and manipulate collections of data efficiently. Working with arrays in C posed some challenges, but I gained valuable insights into memory management and array operations.

## ðŸš€ Topics Covered
- **Introduction to Arrays:**
  - Understanding what arrays are and why they are important.
  - Exploring how arrays are used to store multiple values of the same type.
- **1D Arrays:**
  - Declaration, initialization, and traversal of arrays.
- **Basic Operations on Arrays:**
  - Performing common operations such as searching, sorting, and reversing arrays.

## ðŸ’» Programs Written
The code for the following programs can be found in the **[Day 4 folder](#)** in this repository:
1. **Sum and Average of an Array:** A program to calculate the sum and average of elements in an array.
2. **Largest and Smallest Numbers in an Array:** A program to find the largest and smallest numbers in an array.
3. **Reverse an Array:** A program to reverse the elements of an array without using a second array.
4. **Linear Search in an Array:** A program to implement linear search to find an element in an array.
5. **Second Largest Element in an Array:** A program to find the second largest number in an array.
6. **Merge Two Sorted Arrays:** A program to merge two sorted arrays into a single sorted array.
7. **Remove Duplicates from an Array:** A program to remove duplicate elements from an array.
8. **Binary Search in an Array:** A program to implement binary search in an array.

## ðŸ§  Key Learnings
- **Memory Allocation in C:** I realized that in C, arrays have fixed sizes, unlike Pythonâ€™s flexible lists. This means I have to manage memory more carefully when working with arrays.
- **Syntax Challenges:** I struggled a bit with the syntax, mainly forgetting semicolons and debugging small errors.
- **Fewer Built-in Functions:** C doesnâ€™t provide the same array manipulation functions as Python, which made me implement tasks like sorting and searching manually.
- **Problem Complexity:** Working with arrays in C was more challenging compared to Python, as Python provides more built-in functions like `sort()` and `len()` that simplify array operations.

Each of these tasks gave me a deeper understanding of how arrays work at a low level, and I'm excited to continue building on this foundation!

## ðŸš€ **Next Steps**
- In the next session, I will explore **strings in C**, including string handling functions like `strlen`, `strcpy`, and `strcat`, and learn how to manipulate and work with strings in more advanced ways.
