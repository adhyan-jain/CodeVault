# Day 1: Introduction to C

Welcome to Day 1 of my C programming journey! In this session, I explored the basics of C programming, set up my environment, and wrote my first program.

## ðŸš€ Topics Covered
- **Overview of C Programming:** Introduction to C, its history, and why it's important.
- **Writing the First C Program:** I wrote a simple "Hello, World!" program.
- **Compilation Process:** I learned about how C programs are compiled using `gcc` and the role of IDEs.
- **Variables and Data Types:** Understanding the basic types like `int`, `float`, `char`, etc.
- **Input/Output Functions:** I got hands-on experience with `printf` and `scanf` for displaying and taking input from the user.

## ðŸ’» Programs Written
The code for the following programs can be found in the **[Day 1 folder](#)** in this repository:
1. **Hello World Program**  
2. **User Input Program**  
3. **Arithmetic Operations Program**  
4. **Swapping Two Numbers Program**

## ðŸ§  Key Learnings
- C programming requires understanding the compilation process. I learned that C code is written, compiled by the compiler, and then executed as a program.
- Variables and data types in C are essential to store and manipulate data.
- I became familiar with basic I/O functions (`printf`, `scanf`), which are crucial for interacting with users.
- The arithmetic operations and swapping numbers are foundational problems that I solved using basic operators and control structures.

## ðŸš€ Next Steps
- In the next session, I will dive into **Control Statements**, including `if`, `if-else`, and `switch-case`, along with logical operators.
