# **Day 015: Memory Allocation, Using Arrays, and Static Data Members & Methods**  

## **Topics:**  
- **Memory allocation** in normal functions vs. class methods.  
- **Using arrays** inside a class.  
- **Understanding static data members** and their role in memory optimization.  
- **Static member functions** and their ability to access only static members.  
- **Encapsulation** and how member functions manage data efficiently.  

## **Practice Questions:**

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Implementing a Shop Management System**
üîπ **Task:**
- Define a **class `Shop`** to store **item IDs** and **prices** using arrays.
- Use a **counter variable** to track the number of items added.
- Implement **`setPrice()`** to add items dynamically.
- Implement **`displayPrice()`** to print stored items.

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Optimizing Memory Usage with Static Members**
üîπ **Task:**  
- Modify the **`Shop` class** to use **static data members** where applicable.
- Use a **static counter** instead of an instance variable.
- Demonstrate how static methods work at the class level.
