# Day 20: Destructors & Inheritance  

## Topics Covered  
- **Destructors**: Special member functions that are automatically called when an object goes out of scope or is deleted. Used to release resources.  
- **Single Inheritance**: A derived class inherits from a single base class.  
- **Constructor Execution in Inheritance**: Understanding how constructors behave when a derived class object is created.  

## Practice Tasks  

### 1. Destructors  
**Task:**  
- Implement a destructor to track object creation and destruction.  
- Observe the order of destructor calls when objects go out of scope.  

### 2. Single Inheritance  
**Task:**  
- Create a base class `Employee` with attributes and constructors.  
- Derive a `Programmer` class from `Employee` and add additional attributes.  
- Demonstrate constructor execution and function calls.
