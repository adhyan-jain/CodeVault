# **Day 12: Structures, Unions, and Enums**  

## **Topics:**  
- Understanding **structures** and their use cases in organizing data.  
- Difference between **structures** and **unions** in memory allocation.  
- Using **unions** to store multiple data types efficiently.  
- Working with **enums** to define meaningful constants in C++.  
- Practical applications of structures, unions, and enums in problem-solving.  

## **Practice Questions:**  

1. **Employee Salary Calculation using Structures**  
   - Create a `struct` named `Employee` with attributes like `name`, `id`, and `salary`.  
   - Write a program to find the **employee with the highest salary** from a given list.  

2. **Demonstrating Unions: Storing Different Data Types**  
   - Create a `union` named `Data` with three members: `intVal`, `floatVal`, and `charVal`.  
   - Show how modifying one member affects others due to shared memory allocation.  

3. **Using Enums for Days of the Week**  
   - Define an `enum` for days of the week.  
   - Write a program to take a number (1-7) as input and print the corresponding day using the enum.
