# Bitwise Operations in C++

This project implements various bitwise operations on integers using C++. The following functions are included:

Features
- Get i-th Bit: Extracts the value of the i-th bit from a given number.
- Set i-th Bit: Sets the i-th bit of a number to 1.
- Clear i-th Bit: Clears the i-th bit of a number (sets it to 0).
- Toggle i-th Bit: Flips the i-th bit of a number.
- Update i-th Bit: Updates the i-th bit to a specified value (0 or 1).

How It Works
Each function manipulates bits using bitwise operators:

- AND (&)
- OR (|)
- XOR (^)
- Left Shift (<<)
- Right Shift (>>)
- Bitwise NOT (~)

These operations allow efficient bit manipulation without using loops or conditional statements.
