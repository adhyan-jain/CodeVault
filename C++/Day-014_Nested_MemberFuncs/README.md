## Day 14: Nesting of Member Functions

### Topics:
- Nesting of member functions in C++.
- Private member functions and encapsulation.
- Checking binary format validity.
- Oneâ€™s complement operation.

### Key Concepts:
- `chk_bin` is a **private function** that ensures the input is a valid binary number.
- `ones_compliment` calls `chk_bin`, demonstrating **function nesting**.
- The binary number is displayed before and after flipping bits.

### Practice:
- **Binary Addition**: Create a `Binary` class with a function to add two binary numbers.
